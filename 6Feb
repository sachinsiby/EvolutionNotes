Epigenetics - whether certain genes are turned on or off.
NOt only is the sequence of genes that matter but epigenetics too.
This (Epi) explains why humans could be so complex with less than 30k genes.

Now the next step is to decipher the epigenetic code.

What turns the genes on and off? 


Part of video shows an epigenetic syndrome and babies got this more often
through IVF (artificial conception). So maybe changes in environment
are enough to turn genes on or off? 
On a grander scale, what we experience could affect our children and
our grand children.


Next part shows the effects of 9/11 on stress levels of mother which
transmits to the cortisol levels of the children

Lecture 11: Speculation

Despite the name Origin of Species, there's not much about species.
Darwin missed a few things.


Many of us intuitively recognize different species. The locals recognized
136 species while the ornithologist recognize 137. Thus the idea of 
species is not just arbitrarily created but it objectively existed.
Same species can be said as "They vary but are similar enough
that they belong to the same species".

Pigeons pictures- same species but look really different.


AT what point are the differences between poplations large enough
to make us call them different species?

Species are not different just because they look different but because
they don't mate with eah other.
"Species are groups of potentially inerbreeding polpulations, which are reprodutively
isolated from other such groups"


Why do we bother to define species?
Mutation pops up in the orange thing in pic.
Then when oval population adapts but there's no breeding with the rectangel population
might lead to formation of species?
The biological species is the unit of evolution.


How do species arise?
